## Test Coverage Summary

### Functionality Tested
- ✅ Graph creation and metadata
- ✅ Node operations (add, remove, get, mutate)
- ✅ Edge operations (add, get, directionality)
- ✅ Component system (add, query, remove)
- ✅ Graph algorithms (cycles, topological sort, SCCs, paths)
- ✅ Invariant enforcement
- ✅ Subgraph support
- ✅ Large graph performance
- ✅ Edge cases and error conditions

### Known Limitations
1. **Event System** - Not yet implemented
   - No event emission on graph mutations
   - No event handler registration
   - Tests expecting this functionality were not created

2. **Missing APIs** - Some expected APIs don't exist:
   - `remove_edge()` - Individual edge removal
   - `neighbors()` - Direct neighbor access
   - `clear()` - Clear entire graph
   - Enhanced component queries

3. **Edge Index Stability** - PetGraph limitation
   - When nodes are removed, edge indices may change
   - This affects edge lookups after node removal
   - Workaround: Use edge IDs in nodes() list rather than get_edge()

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Event System** - Add event-driven capabilities as specified in requirements
2. **Add Missing APIs** - Implement commonly expected graph operations
3. **Fix Edge Mapping** - Update edge mappings when nodes are removed
4. **Create Performance Benchmarks** - Add benchmarks for large graphs
5. **Document API** - Create comprehensive API documentation

## Test Execution

To run all tests:
```bash
# All tests in the crate
cargo test

# Specific test suites
cargo test --test comprehensive_contextgraph_tests
cargo test --test working_unit_tests
cargo test --test context_graph_integration_tests

# With output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Conclusion

The ContextGraph implementation successfully passes comprehensive user story tests and rigorous unit tests. The implementation provides:
- Strong type safety with Rust
- Component-based extensibility
- Integration with PetGraph algorithms
- Support for complex domain modeling

While some advanced features (events, additional APIs) are not yet implemented, the core functionality is solid and well-tested.
